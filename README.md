# a/A Open - Codes

Welcome to my App Academy Open Repo! This repo contains a collection of all the code examples, exercises, and additional programming practices that I’ve completed as part of my
learning journey through App Academy Open.

## About

Here, you’ll find a well-organized structure that reflects my work across various topics covered in the curriculum, ranging from fundamental exercises to more complex coding examples. Each folder is
dedicated to a specific topic, containing code snippets, exercises, and other hands-on coding practices that I’ve found beneficial for mastering each concept.

### Note

Since larger projects require their own repositories, I’ve excluded them from this collection. Instead, I will create separate, dedicated repositories for each project I undertake to ensure a clean,
organized collection of my work.

## File Names

### JavaScript

- **Example Code** → `exercise.js`
